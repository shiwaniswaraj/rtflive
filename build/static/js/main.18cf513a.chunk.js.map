This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention. </p>\n            <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;4.6&nbsp;<u>Aggregate Anonymous Information:</u> Aggregated Anonymous Information is the combination of your Anonymous Information with the Anonymous Information of other Users (“Aggregated Anonymous Information”). Aggregated Anonymous Information does not allow you to be identified or contacted. We may share such Aggregated Anonymous Information with third parties. </p>\n            <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;4.7&nbsp;We may share your Personal Information with any of our subsidiaries, joint venturers, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. Additionally, in the event we undergo a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred, and your Personal Information may be shared as part of the negotiation of the transaction. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any entity that acquires us, is merged with us or that acquires our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n            <p align=\"justify\"><strong>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong></p>\n            <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;5.1&nbsp;Through your use of the Site(s), we may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information from you (“NPII”). NPII is not associated with you as an individual. It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate. We use NPII to maintain and administer the Site(s), analyze trends, gather demographic information and comply with applicable law. We may share this information with others without express notice to you or consent from you, and we may exploit, use and disclose your NPII without limitation of any kind. </p>\n            <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;5.2&nbsp;The Site(s) may use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Site(s) that is saved on your hard drive by your computer's browser. Cookies help us remember you when you return to the Site(s). Cookies also hold information to personalize and enhance your experience and to gather Site(s) statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the Internet provider's domain name and the addresses of the sites you visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving the Site(s). The information in the cookies lets us trace your \"clickstream\" activity (i.e., the paths taken by users of the Site(s) as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve you by revealing which portions of the Site(s) are the most popular. We may also allow our affiliate and service providers and advertisers to serve cookies from the Site(s) to allow them to assist us in various activities such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of the Site(s), its content and advertising. Some third party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offer a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. For more information, see: <a href=\"www.networkadvertising.org\">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.  </p>\n            <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;5.3&nbsp;We may also use \"pixel tags\" (sometimes called \"web beacons\" or \"clear gifs\"), which are tiny graphic images, on the Site(s). Pixel tags help us analyze users’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of the Site(s) and our advertising and marketing. Pixel tags or Clear gif files are tiny graphics with a unique label that work in a similar way to cookies and are used to monitor the user’s online activities. In contrast to cookies that are saved on a user’s computer hard disk, clear gif files are embedded invisibly in websites and are about as big as the full stop at the end of this sentence. Where appropriate, we may combine the information collected by such pixel tags with the Personal Information of our customers. We may also use other analytical tools to evaluate site performance through the use of aggregated data, which contain no Personal Information. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information. </p>\n            <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;5.4&nbsp;Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools that we may use on the Site(s) may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Site(s). This information may include your computer's Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the Site(s) you visited immediately before coming to the Site(s). Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools in our emails may also be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us. We may also work with businesses that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Site(s) and your interaction with our advertising and other communications, but no Personal Information is shared with them. </p>\n            <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;5.5&nbsp;We may combine the NPII collected through cookies, pixel tags and other analytical tools with other information we may have collected from you. This information may be used to improve the Site(s), to personalize your online experience, to help us deliver information to you, to determine the effectiveness of advertising, and for other internal business purposes. We may use and share aggregated and anonymous information to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves and/or for our business partners. Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of such information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use or disclose such information. For example, we may freely share such information with third parties who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes. We may also freely share such information with our service providers in order for them to perform services to or for us. </p>\n            <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;5.6&nbsp;We authorize certain service providers to utilize NPII for their business purposes and in accordance with their privacy policies, such as to report on usage or industry trends to their customer base.  </p>\n            <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;5.7&nbsp;Third Party Functionalities: The Site(s) contains links to and/or enables certain third party functionalities to enhance your experience on the Site(s), including social plug-ins, tools and APIs.

Further, please note that we may be required to maintain certain Personal Information, or to maintain certain Personal Information for a period of time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements. When we delete any information, it will be deleted from our active database, but may remain in our archives. We may retain your information for fraud detection or similar purposes. Note that if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot compel the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.
